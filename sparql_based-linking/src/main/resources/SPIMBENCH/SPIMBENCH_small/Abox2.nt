The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a 90-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammates hit or other means." .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baseball> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players. The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a 90-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammates hit or other means." .

Steering is done by flexing the sleds runners with the calf of each leg or exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat. Racing sleds weigh 21-25 kilograms (46-55 lbs. ) for singles and 25-30 kilograms (55-66 lbs. ) for doubles. Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport. Of the three Olympic sliding sports, which include bobsleigh and skeleton, luge is the fastest and most dangerous." .

The (baize) cloth on a snooker table has a directional nap running from the balk end of the table towards the end with the (black ball) spot. This affects how a ball rolls depending on which direction it is hit or shot." .

It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends. The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball. To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs." .

At the turn of the 21st century, the game was played by over 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the worlds most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf, with a goal in the middle of each of the short ends." .

It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends. The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball. To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs." .

It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends. The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball. To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs." .

Standings are determined first by successful completion of the course, then by shortest time on course." .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baseball> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players. The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a 90-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammates hit or other means." .

It resembles the sport of Olympic weightlifting, as both disciplines involve lifting weights in three attempts. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as odd lifts, which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three." .

The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a 90-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammates hit or other means." .

It is played on a pitch which may be flat (for flat-green bowls) or convex or uneven (for crown-green bowls). It is normally played outdoors although there are some indoor venues and the surface is either natural grass, artificial turf, or cotula." .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geocaching> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity, first played in May 2000, in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called geocaches or caches, anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook where the geocacher enters the date they found it and signs it with their established code name." .

It is the national sport of Argentina since 1953. Pato is Spanish for duck, as early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. Accounts of early versions of pato have been written since 1610. The playing field would often stretch the distance between neighboring estancias (ranches)." .

In Canada and the United States, where the sport is very popular, it is known simply as hockey; however, the name ice hockey is used by the governing body IIHF and in most other countries. There the word hockey is generally reserved for another form of the sport, such as field hockey or roller hockey." .

The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball. To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs." .
